This repository contains Python-based algorithmic problems inspired by embedded systems engineering interviews. These challenges test skills in optimization, resource constraints, and data processing for embedded environments.

Problems:

Subset Sum Closest to Target
Minimize Power Consumption
Memory Allocation Optimization
